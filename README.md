# About Me
Hey, I'm Trayambak! I am a student. I am fascinated with computers and programming. I like Maths and English.
I am a freelancer and I have worked for a Discord server with 1.7k members as a bot developer. (Currently not for hire)
I currently use Nim and Python. I love Nim and nowadays write most of my stuff in it.
I use Fedora Linux as my daily driver (Arch previously).
Nim FTW!

Have a great day!
