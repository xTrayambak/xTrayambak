# xTrayambak
Nim developer, previously indie game developer.
Nothing much to see here, I like making Rust programmers cope and seethe, and that's about it.

# My stance on software
I believe all software should give users the right to modify and hack around with it. Forks are great, but certain types of forks that are parasitic should be avoided at all costs (see Dissenter).

Software need not be simple, it does not need to be dumbed down to the point that it does nothing beyond it's current feature set.
Large projects (or projects intended to be large) should instead be split into smaller components to reduce code complexity.
This is never always the case, but it generally is the best way to go around doing things.

Rust is a curse of a language. Not the projects written in it by misguided programmers, but rather the language is deeply flawed.
Taking away control from the user is stupid. It is the entire "you shall be dumbed down and you will like it" formula that every Red Hat conspirator loves to preach but never talks about it when it comes to Rust. Screw you, I will deallocate nil pointers when I feel like it and you cannot do anything to stop me. This is why I love Nim. It trusts the user to not be a nutjob and that's great.
