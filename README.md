# About Me
Hey, I'm Trayambak! I am a student. I am fascinated with computers and programming. I like Maths and English.
I am a freelancer and I have worked for a Discord server with 1.7k members as a bot developer. (Currently, not for hire)
I specialize in Python, at the moment. I love Python and write most of my stuff in it.
I use Arch Linux as my daily driver (Fedora previously).
My dream job is to be a successful game developer, whilst embracing open-source! I believe that if code is shared together by huge companies, then humanity can progress 100x faster!
Python FTW!
I write backends in Python, and for that, I made my own simple serverless database.

Have a great day! <3
